                    <h2 class="home_section_title">Teaching</h2>
                    <p>My teaching philosophy is centered around creating an <strong>active, inclusive, and safe learning environment</strong> that fosters the creation of <strong>deep learning knowledge</strong> among my students. I believe using <strong>technology</strong> can greatly support and enhance student learning, especially when it is applied following <strong>evidence-based</strong> best teaching practices. My goal as a Structural Engineering Professor is to develop on my students the skills and knowledge necessary for success in the field and to empower them with learning tools that will allow them to take ownership of their own learning and further professional development. I conduct myself with <strong>integrity</strong> following strict <strong>codes of conduct</strong> established by the institutions where I work, I strive to adopt <strong>diversity, equity, and inclusion</strong> principles by respecting my students' and colleagues' identity, nationality, socioeconomic level, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, and age. I am interested in implementing a <strong>Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)</strong> approach on my teaching practice to contribute to the improvement of teaching in structural engineering by publishing and sharing my own experience and expertise on educational journals.</p>
                    <!-- <p>I participated in my first teaching experience during my senior years of Bachelor studies when I was invited by the Student Union to facilitate a short course on <strong>computer aided design (CAD)</strong> to first year students of the Department of Civil Engineering. I found this experience to be very fulfilling and satisfactory.</p> -->
                    <p>As a Phd student at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, I obtained my first formal teaching/pedagogical education by participating in several workshops and courses facilitated by the <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/academicpractice/" target="_blank">Academic Practice</a> unit:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reflective teaching assistantship course.</li>
                        <li>CAPSL Postgraduate teaching assistant workshop: How students learn?</li>
                        <li>CAPSL Postgraduate teaching assistant workshop: Session planning.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Furthermore, I received formal training on Programme Focused Assessment (from where I obtained a <a href="/documents/Digital_badge.pdf" target="_blank">digital badge</a>) and I worked as Assessment Assistant supporting Trinity Assessment Fellows to map and analyze assessment practices within Schools across the University.</p>
                    <p>I have also been involved in the design of new study programs. In 2021, I was invited by Dr. Miguel Zamora Palacios, Head of the Department of Civil and Topographic Engineering at University of Guadalajara, Mexico, to participate in the Committee of the creation of a new Master Program on Civil Engineering, whose first edition will take place on 2023.</p>
